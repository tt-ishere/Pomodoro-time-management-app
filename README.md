# Pomodoro-time-management-app
 This a simple yet functional GUI for a Pomodoro timer, which allows users to manage their time more efficiently.
This is for a graphical user interface (GUI) of a Pomodoro timer. The code uses the tkinter module for creating GUIs.

The GUI contains a canvas where an image of a tomato is displayed, and a label with the current timer status. The window also has two buttons: Start and Reset, and a label that displays a checkmark every time a work session is completed.

There are several constants defined at the beginning of the code, including colors and font names, as well as the duration of the work and break sessions, and the number of completed work sessions.

There are four functions defined in the code:

    reset_timer(): This function resets the timer and the checkmarks to their initial state. It cancels the previous timer using after_cancel(), sets the timer text to "00:00", and the tittle_label to "Timer".

    start_timer(): This function starts the timer based on the current work and break session duration. The function first increments the reps variable by 1, which keeps track of the number of completed work sessions. Then, it checks whether it's time for a long break or a short break, based on the number of completed work sessions. If it's time for a break, the count_down() function is called with the break duration. Otherwise, the count_down() function is called with the work session duration.

    count_down(count): This function is responsible for counting down the timer. It first converts the duration to minutes and seconds and displays it on the canvas using canvas.itemconfig(). It then checks whether the timer has finished counting down. If it hasn't, it decrements the timer by 1 second using window.after(). If it has finished, it adds a checkmark to the checkmark_label for each completed work session, and calls the start_timer() function to begin the next work or break session.

    mainloop(): This function is responsible for running the window and its components. It creates the window object, sets its properties such as the window title, size, and background color, and adds all the widgets to it. It then runs the main loop of the window using the mainloop() method.
